# Deep Learning for Vision-based Prediction
This repository serves as a reference database for the paper [Deep Learning for Vision-based Prediction: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.00095.pdf). Here you can find the list of **vison-based prediction** papers that use **deep learning** and are published since **2015**. The goal is to maintain this repository by adding papers published as they become available online.

All the papers contain the following information: **datasets** and **metrics** they use as well as corresponding **bibtex** and **links** to all published papers. The bibtex of all papers can also be found in `prediction_refs.bib`.

Similar to the survey paper, the papers are categorized into 5 groups: **Video**, **Action**, **Trajectory**, **Motion** and **Other** which may include applications such as visual weather forecasting, fashion trends prediction, etc.

The repository also contains information about the datasets used in the papers. Here, for each dataset, in addition to the **links** to the dataset and corresponding **papers**,  you can find information regarding  **applications**, **type or annotations**, **task**, **list of papers** used the dataset and **bibtex** of the publication.

To search for papers, you can use one of the following options:

* [Papers](papers/papers.md#top)
  * [Video prediction](papers/video_papers.md#top)
  * [Action prediction](papers/action_papers.md#top)
  * [Trajectory prediction](papers/trajectory_papers.md#top)
  * [Motion prediction](papers/motion_papers.md#top)
  * [Other prediction](papers/other_papers.md#top)
  * [Papers with code](papers/papers_with_code.md#top)
* [Datasets](datasets/datasets.md#top)
  * [Year](datasets/year_datasets.md#top)
  * [Application](datasets/application_datasets.md#top)
  * [Task](datasets/task_datasets.md#top)
  * [Annotation](datasets/annotation_datasets.md#top)
