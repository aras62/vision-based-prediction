# Datasets for vision-based prediction
 The datasets used in vision-based prediction papers are categorized according to:
* <a href=year_datasets.md#top>Year</a> the dataset was published.  The objective of video prediction algorithms is to generate future scenes, often in the form of RGB images.
* <a href=application/application_datasets.md#top>Application</a> that the dataset is used in. The application can be one of the five that used in this database, e.g. video or motion prediction.
* <a href=task_datasets.md#top>Task</a> of the data in the dataset. For example, driving, cooking, activity, etc. the future trajectories of objects, i.e. the future positions of the objects over time.
* <a href=annotation_datasets.md#top>Annotation</a> available in the dataset and data type. This may include RGB images, bounding boxes, activity labels, etc.
Note that the datasets are often used in different applications and contain different annotations. As a result, some datasets might appear in multiple groups in different categorizations.
