# Datasets for vision-based prediction
 The datasets used in vision-based prediction papers are categorized according to:
* <a href=year_datasets.md#top>Year</a> the dataset was published.  The objective of video prediction algorithms is to generate future scenes, often in the form of RGB images.
* <a href=application_datasets.md#top>Application</a> that the dataset is used in. The application can be one of the five that used in this database, e.g. video or motion prediction.
* <a href=task_datasets.md#top>Task</a> of the data in the dataset. For example, driving, cooking, activity, etc. the future trajectories of objects, i.e. the future positions of the objects over time.
* <a href=annotation_datasets.md#top>Annotations</a> available in the dataset. This may include RGB images, bounding boxes, activity labels, etc.
