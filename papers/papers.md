# Papers for vision-based prediction
Vison-based prediction papers are categorized in to 6 groups according to their applications and wether they are associated with code. For the list of papers in each category click on the name of the application. Note that some papers present algorithms for multiple tasks so they might appear in more than one category.
* <a href=video_papers.md#top>Video</a> or future scene prediction can be regarded as the most generic form of prediction.  The objective of video prediction algorithms is to generate future scenes, often in the form of RGB images.
* <a href=action_papers.md#top>Action</a> prediction algorithms are used to predict future activities or events given partial  or no observations of future activities or events.
* <a href=trajectory_papers.md#top>Trajectory</a> prediction algorithms predict the future trajectories of objects, i.e. the future positions of the objects over time.
* <a href=motion_papers.md#top>Motion</a> prediction algorithms are those designed to predict future changes in human pose.
* <a href=other_papers.md#top>Other</a>  prediction includes algorithms such as visual weather prediction, occupancy grid map prediction, contest outcome prediction, etc.
* <a href=papers_with_code.md#top>Papers with code</a> page provides an alternative search of papers that have published code available online.
